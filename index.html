                        <!-- This is the 1st sub-heading on the website-->
                <p>In a bright, sunny jungle by the sparkling sea, three unlikely friends met every morning for their favorite game: tennis.</p>
                <p><strong>Milo the Monkey</strong> was the fastest. He swung from vines, bounced on branches, and could leap across the court in a single hop.</p>
                <p><strong>Saffy the Seahorse</strong> lived in the shallow tidepool beside the court. She couldn't run, but she had a magical ability: she could float the ball gently through the air with tiny swirls of water.</p>
                <p><strong>Percy the Peacock</strong> was the most dazzling player. Whenever he hit the ball, his tail feathers shimmered like a rainbow, and the ball sparkled as it flew.</p>
                <p>One morning, Milo arrived with a big grin. “Let's play a match!” he said, twirling his racket.</p>
                <p>Saffy bubbled happily. “I'll serve first!”</p>
                <p>She spun in a circle, sending a soft splash upward. The tennis ball rose with the water and drifted over the net like a floating bubble. Milo dashed forward, swung hard, and sent it soaring toward Percy.</p>
                <p>Percy fluttered his feathers proudly. “Watch this!” He tapped the ball with a graceful flick, and it glided back with a trail of glittering light.</p>
                <p>The friends played and laughed, each using their special talents. Milo's speed, Saffy's gentle water magic, and Percy's elegant aim made the game exciting and silly all at once.</p>
                <p>Finally, after a long <em>rally</em>, the ball bounced off a rock and plopped into Saffy's tidepool.</p>
                <p>She giggled. "I think that means the game is over!" Milo flopped onto the grass. “Best match ever.” Percy nodded, fanning his feathers. “We make a perfect team.”</p>
                <p> And from that day on, the monkey, the seahorse, and the peacock met every morning—proving that tennis is even more fun when everyone plays in their own special way.</p>
